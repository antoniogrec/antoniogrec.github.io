						<h2 class="entry-title">The Culture</h2>
						<p>One should never underestimate the importance of securing an attorney from your own culture to reach your goals. You should be even more careful when seeking a lawyer abroad. And while a local attorney can be important, lawyers foreign to your culture may insist that you settle your matter in a manner that falls short of your goals. You do not want a lawyer that does not understand your specific needs any more than you want to a hairdresser to remodel your kitchen.</p>

									<p>COMPLIANCE With international law Few people realize the obstacles in serving defendants abroad otherwise known as service of process. Laws governing who may notify a defendant internationally differ by country. What laws apply to service in your country, often times do not apply internationally. American lawyers that need to notify an international defendant are told to research the long-arm statute. However, these laws do not always tell the attorney critical information. These laws fail to mention that the proof of…</p>

									<p>The Dolce Vita Most people think that Italy is a well organized country and people are held accountable. Surely any nuptials in your home country should be quickly and efficiently recognized abroad. Though the reality is that most legal systems are anything but straightforward and efficient. A simple visa could take months or years when dealing with 2 different legal systems, 2 different languages, and significantly different time zones. The Italian immigration system is a labyrinth that can make even…</p>

									<p>What is a Will A Will is a document that clearly states the desires regarding the distribution of equity after a death. It is important to understand that you have to meet specific legal requirements for the Will to be valid. Intestate is the legal process if someone dies without a Will. Intestate dictates that all assets are divided by applicable local laws regardless of the decedent’s wishes. In other words, no one may assert what they believe to be…</p>

									<p>Unfortunately, most people fail to make things easier for their loved ones when they pass. The overwhelming majority of decedents pass without a Will.  I cannot recommend strongly enough that you establish how to distributors assets when you pass. Many people often say, but I don’t have anything anyway. Often times though, you don’t know what you have when you die. You could have rights to the assets of someone else. You’re passing can bestow rights to your spouse or step family. And you can only imagine how these tasks become insurmountable when they involve international family affairs.</p>

									<p>In this new age of globalism, many people dream of obtaining a second citizenship. Just as many people also think they are able to self-diagnose their medical issues and resolve most if not all of their legal and bureaucratic challenges. Unfortunately, like many incorrect medical self-diagnoses, most people are unable to resolve their legal and bureaucratic challenges without specialized help. People don’t often have the first-hand experience of obtaining new or second citizenship to know what obstacles can occur. Many…</p>

We are in an age of independence that breaks both past obligations imposed on unions from the church, as well as prior limits in geographical location. Couples are more international than ever before. Italians are not moving to the Americas with other Italians. Oftentimes, a British person will immigrate to Italy with a Swiss or American national for example. In all the excitement of an adventurous new…</p>

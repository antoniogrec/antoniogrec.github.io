								<h2>Welcome To Avral Legal </h2>
								<p>Our firm focuses primarily on Italian law, American law, and the international laws that regulate the relationship between the United States and most of Europe. Our lawyers are experts in family law in both Italy and the USA. Our lawyers manage matters involving legal separation, divorce, separation when not married, child custody, child support, spousal support and alimony, domestic violence, adoption and parental kidnapping (Hague convention).</p>
								<p>Our attorneys also manage matters of general civil litigation, including employment law, estate management (will, trusts, inheritance & probate proceedings), immigration, real estate, and criminal law. Laws are very often much more complex than you understood. Matters become even more complex and justice more elusive when international elements are present or you must manage the case from afar. We are here to help you.</p>

									<p>COMPLIANCE With international law Few people realize the obstacles in serving defendants abroad otherwise known as service of process. Laws governing who may notify a defendant internationally differ by country. What laws apply to service in your country, often times do not apply internationally. American lawyers that need to notify an international defendant are told to research the long-arm statute. However, these laws do not always tell the attorney critical information. These laws fail to mention that the proof of…</p>

									<p>The Dolce Vita Most people think that Italy is a well organized country and people are held accountable. Surely any nuptials in your home country should be quickly and efficiently recognized abroad. Though the reality is that most legal systems are anything but straightforward and efficient. A simple visa could take months or years when dealing with 2 different legal systems, 2 different languages, and significantly different time zones. The Italian immigration system is a labyrinth that can make even…</p>

									<p>What is a Will A Will is a document that clearly states the desires regarding the distribution of equity after a death. It is important to understand that you have to meet specific legal requirements for the Will to be valid. Intestate is the legal process if someone dies without a Will. Intestate dictates that all assets are divided by applicable local laws regardless of the decedent’s wishes. In other words, no one may assert what they believe to be…</p>

											<p>As a foreigner coming to Italy and not speaking the language, Antonio and his legal team had been incredibly helpful in all legal and bureaucratic procedures. I felt like I had, and still have, someone I can turn to for advice, which has provided me with a sense of comfort here in Italy. A personal, and still professional team. Thank you!!</p>

											<p>Antonio Greco and his team are a unique group that I value immensely! As an Italian/American living in Italy the laws and bureaucracy can be challenging! Mr. Vasi and Ms. Miklos have provided me with an array of quality services with a delicate balance of professional and personal touch.
They are an energetic team providing sound advice and solutions based on their combined vast knowledge and experience in the legal system.
I am completely content with my client / attorney relationship and highly recommend them.!</p>
